# AppBlade Platforms

AppBlade Platforms allow AppBlade to work across multiple platforms (iOS, BlackBerry, Android;) these libraries are responsible for inspecting packages, creating manifests, device identification, parsing crash reports, and more.

## Intent

We have gotten a lot of interest in adding additional platforms, some of which don't have a business case yet. Interested parties could be encouraged by the open-source nature of our Platform support.

## State of the Blade

* iOS executables are well supported
* Android is working rather well
* BlackBerry is meh
* Windows Mobile is a definite need
* Windows Desktop and OSX Desktop are two emerging needs
* We are getting requested about Symbian support

## Work in progress

This is a work in progress, we are extracting these modules from AppBlade Core.
